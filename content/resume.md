## Notable Projects

### Nursery Management Tool

**ðŸš§ Work in Progress**

A 100% Rust tool to manage a Nursery operation across multiple locations for a non-profit. Minimizing long term maintenance and exploring the WASM capabilities of Rust are primary objectives in this project. If you're interested in more details check out the [project page](@/projects/mangrove-manager.md).

### Distributed Computation Platform

A microservice-based platform, developed at Olive AI to facilitate the automation of healthcare administration tasks, that allowed arbitrary products to operate with a "batteries included" SDK to decrease time-to-market of new offerings. The primary function of the platform was to provide build-time and runtime abstractions to operate functions as microservices on AWS Lambda. This allowed the consuming developers to focus on writing business logic to transform customer request data into a completed task. These abstractions also established logging and observability tools that were enabled and configured by default, ensuring that all software on the platform could be monitored confidently. The platform also provided infrastructure to deploy a standardized database and a runtime interface to define the data model from code.
